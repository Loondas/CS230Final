# CS230Final

The Gaming Room wanted to recreate their mobile app Draw It or Lose It on a multi-system platform.
This application was to work on as many systems simultaneously as possible.

I believe my document accounts for a wide variety of factors, analyzing each in a high level of detail.
The list of requirements is especially handy, as solving problems tends to present an issue when 
recognizing the scope of the issue. Listing problems and solving according to needs maintains focus.

Unfortunately, I neglected mentioning techniques which could help efficiency, such as image compression.
I would likely go further in depth with memory and storage management, highlighting details which 
improve efficiency in these area.

The user's needs were mostly explicitely stated. However, there was some implicit information to be
found; Being a game, responsiveness and a strong UI are important. As the game is already existant
on another platform, maintaining the original design is also important. Without keeping these details
in mind, the customer is likely not to be satisfied with the finished product, leading to a falling out
and preventing the customer from utilizing your services in the future. Additionally, it impacts your
standing in the industry, reducing the likelihood of your services to be in demand.

Designing the software, I did basic research to find technology which fits the needs and has a high
level of documentation. To appeal to as broad an audience as possible, I ensured as much software as
possible is handled on the back end. In the future, my first design decision will likely hinge on the
user base; If attempting to connect multiple users, server-side management is the way to go. Otherwise,
I believe client-side management is superior on most devices. The exception is when file size becomes
an encumberance. If the program takes multible gigabytes, server-side hosting may be preferable.
